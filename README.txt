VERSION: 0.1
DESCRIPTION: A 2d platformer, based partially on Symphony of the Night, made in Python and Pygame 
that is easy to add features, levels, and mechanics to. It is currently in a functional state, 
however, there are many features I will add in the near future. Programmed by Colton Unruh.

REQUIRMENTS: The exe file runs on Windows 7 and 10. It may run on other versions, but this has not been tested.
If you want to run the source code script, you need Python 3.3 or above as well as the pygame library.

INSTRUCTIONS: The .exe file for the game is located in the pyformer_v0.1\dist and is called platformer.exe. Simply double click the file to run it.

CONTROLS:
Arrow keys to move, SPACE to jump, 'Z' to attack, 'X' to switch weapons, ESCAPE to pause.
F1 to toggle the framerate, F2 to toggle the player's position.
